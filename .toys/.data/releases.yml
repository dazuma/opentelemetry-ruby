# List of all releasable gems. Each gem should include:
#  *  name: The name of the gem. (Required.)
#  *  directory: Gem directory relative to the repo root.
#     (Required unless the gem name matches the directory name exactly. This
#     means it's always required in this repo because all the gem names include
#     the word "opentelemetry" whereas the directory names do not.)
#  *  version_rb_path: Path to version.rb relative to the gem directory.
#     (Required only if it does not match the gem name. e.g. The gem
#     "opentelemetry-sdk" would default to "lib/opentelemetry/sdk/version.rb",
#     so this field is required only if the actual path is different.)
#  *  version_constant: The fully-qualified version constant as an array.
#     (Required if the actual constant name, including its capitalization,
#     differs from what would be inferred from the gem name. This means it's
#     always required in this repo, because the capitalization of the
#     "OpenTelemetry" namespace does not match the gem name "opentelemetry".)
#  *  changelog_path: Path to CHANGELOG.md relative to the gem directory.
#     (Required only if it is not in the expected location, which is the file
#     "CHANGELOG.md" at the root of the gem directory.)
